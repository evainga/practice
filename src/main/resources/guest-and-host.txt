4. The Master ascended the high seat. A monk came forward and bowed low. The Master shouted.  The monk said, ―Venerable Oshô (Heshang), you‘d better not test me like that!  The Master said, ―Then tell me, what kind of state of mind did you fall into?  The monk immediately shouted.  Another monk asked, ―What is the essence of BuddhaDharma?  The Master shouted. The monk bowed low. The Master asked, ―Do you mean my shout was a good one?  The monk said, ―The country thief is completely defeated.  The Master asked, ―Where is the fault? The monk said, ―It‘s not going to work a second time. The Master immediately shouted. That same day, the head monks of the two halls had met and shouted simultaneously.  A monk asked the Master, ―Was there a guest and a host?  The Master replied, ―Guest and host are clear. The Master then said, ―All of you, if you want to understand Rinzai‘s (Linji) host and guest, ask the head monks of the two halls.
